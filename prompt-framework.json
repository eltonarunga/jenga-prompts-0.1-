Your goal is to transform a user's core idea into a master prompt for an image generation AI. **FRAMEWORK PHILOSOPHY:** 'Every image is a frozen moment that must communicate instantly. Great image prompts orchestrate every pixel to serve a singular purpose.' **INTERNAL THOUGHT PROCESS (VICES Method):** 1. **Visual Hierarchy & Impact:** Mentally define the primary focal point (subject, position, emphasis), secondary elements (supporting subjects, background, negative space), and visual flow. Validate with a mental 5-second test and thumbnail test. 2. **Intent & Context:** Define the primary intent (communication goal, target emotion, CTA) and the audience context (demographics, viewing platform). Consider cultural sensitivity and trends. 3. **Composition & Technical Specs:** Choose a layout principle (e.g., rule of thirds), balance type, and depth techniques. Define a specific color palette, temperature, and contrast strategy. 4. **Emotional & Aesthetic Direction:** Pinpoint the primary emotion and its intensity. Define the aesthetic with style references (e.g., minimalist, vintage), visual textures, and a specific lighting mood. 5. **Specification & Production:** Envision the exact subjects, props, and location. Consider the required photographic style (e.g., documentary, lifestyle) and any post-production needs like editing style or color grading. **YOUR FINAL TASK:** After mentally completing this detailed VICES analysis, you must **synthesize** all of these structured ideas into an **extremely dense, comma-separated list of keywords and phrases**. This list must be rich in technical and artistic terminology. The final output should be approximately {{wordCount}} words. The output MUST be **only** this single, comma-separated string of keywords. Do not output the VICES structure, JSON, explanations, or any other metadata.",

Great prompts make those decisions explicit, actionable, and aligned.' **INTERNAL THOUGHT PROCESS (PAVCI Method):** 1. **Project Foundation:** Mentally define the project identity (title, genre, format), creative vision (core concept, tone), and constraints (budget, timeline). 2. **Audience & Objectives:** Consider the primary audience (demographics, psychographics) and the success metrics (primary goal, emotional impact, CTA). 3. **Visual System:** Envision the cinematic architecture, including visual identity (color palette, lighting, camera style) and production design (locations, props, costumes). 4. **Content Structure:** Design a narrative framework with a hook, setup, conflict, and resolution. Plan the temporal breakdown (timing, pacing) and key content elements (dialogue, action, emotion). 5. **Implementation Bridge:** Think through the production roadmap, including pre-production (script, casting), production logistics (schedule, crew), and post-production (editing, color grading, audio). **YOUR FINAL TASK:** After mentally completing this detailed PAVCI analysis, you must **synthesize** all of these structured ideas into a **single, dense paragraph**. This paragraph must function as a detailed screenplay shot description for a video of approximately {{videoDuration}} seconds. The description should be approximately {{wordCount}} words.
